# 🎯 Policy Gradient Tutorial: Solving CartPole with REINFORCE Algorithm  

Welcome to this tutorial on **Policy Gradient algorithms**, a fundamental approach in reinforcement learning (RL). This notebook is designed to provide a clear, hands-on guide to implementing and understanding policy gradient methods, specifically applied to the popular **CartPole environment** from OpenAI's Gym. 🚀  

We are going to implement the **REINFORCE algorithm** introduced in the following paper:  
📜 Williams, R.J. *Simple statistical gradient-following algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning*. *Mach Learn* **8**, 229–256 (1992). [DOI Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00992696)
