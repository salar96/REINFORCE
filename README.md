Title:
Policy Gradient Tutorial: Solving CartPole with REINFORCE Algorithm

Description:
This repository provides a hands-on tutorial on implementing Policy Gradient algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL), specifically using the REINFORCE algorithm to solve the classic CartPole problem from OpenAI's Gym. It includes a step-by-step guide, with clear explanations of the theory, code implementation, and key concepts, helping both beginners and intermediate learners understand how policy gradient methods can be applied to solve real-world control problems.

Key highlights:

Implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm from scratch.
Exploration of policy gradient methods and their benefits.
Practical application on the CartPole environment.
Ideal for learners interested in diving into reinforcement learning and policy-based methods! ðŸš€
